# Matrix
The Matrix for the 6502 written in S-C Macro Assembler 2.0

This is my attempt at using 6502 assembler code to write a Matrix simulator.

Place MATRIX.ASM and RANDOM.ASM in the same directory, then load and assemble MATRIX.ASM.
This will create the binary file MATRIX, which can then be executed.
CTRL-Q exits The Matrix ... if you believe this to be possible ;-)
